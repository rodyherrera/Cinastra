#### Private, anonymous and temporary messaging for everyone
Cinastra is a private and temporary messaging web service that allows you to interact with people around the world through rooms, you can create the rooms that you want in an unlimited way and with unlimited users within them, everything that is spoken will not be saved in the cloud or in some database, everything is stored at runtime.

### Installation
To install and run this software without problems you will need to do the installation `step by step`, take some time and read the installation process in detail, this because `you will have to apply a small configuration that will be to tell the client the address of the server to the one to connect`.

```bash
# Cloning the repository
git clone https://github.com/CodeWithRodi/Cinastra/
# Accessing the generated directory
cd Cinastra
# Accessing the client's source code directory and installing the nodes_modules
cd Client && npm install
# Accessing the server directory and installing the node_modules
cd ../Server && npm install
```

Once you have installed the node_modules from the client and server source code, `we can move on to the next section that pertains to the configuration so that you can correctly mount the services`.

### Configuring the Server application
Inside the repository directory there is the `Server folder`, where it has a `.json file that is called Infrastructure`, this file contains statements that will be used throughout the execution of the server, in this file you must `configure the address where you want the server is running`, where you must declare the hostname and port of the same, by `default the hostname is '0.0.0.0' and the port is 6500`, you can modify them to your need, the file would be something like this:

```bash
"Server": {
    "DefaultHostname": "0.0.0.0",
    "DefaultPort": 6500
}
```

If you do not want to apply the configuration of the server address statically you can set it every time you run the server, this passing it as an argument to call, clearly for this you have to be inside the Server directory.

```bash
npm start port::6500 hostname::0.0.0.0
# Or
npm start port=6500 hostname=0.0.0.0
```

### Configuring the Client application
It is time to give the last touch to start our messaging application, we must start the client application, but `the client application does NOT know which is the address of the server` to which it has to connect to start interacting with the Socket, it is That is why the client application also contains a `configuration file, this is located inside its directory, in the 'src' folder`, therefore you must enter the Client directory, then the src directory and then open the `Infrastructure.json` file , in which you will find a key called `"Backend"` which has another called `"Server"` that must have as value `the address of the server that was previously established`, this should look something like this:
```bash
"Backend": {
    "Server": "https://api.cinastra.codewithrodi.com/",
    "ConnectionTimeOut": 10000
}
```
The value of the "Server" key must contain the ENDPOINT or address where the Cinastra backend is running, in this case, the default value is "https://api.codewithrodi.com", where it is located the backend of the demo application.

### Starting the application
You should open two consoles, one to initialize the client's server and the other to initialize the server.
```bash
# (IN THE ROOT DIRECTORY)
cd Client && npm run start
```

Now on the other console
```bash
# (IN THE ROOT DIRECTORY)
cd Server && npm run start
```

The servers should be initialized so that if you access the React application server you could already be viewing content and if the server has loaded you can start using the application.

### Using SSL
For the server it is quite similar, the only thing you have to do is go to the configuration file that is located at the root of the `'Server'` directory and look for where it says `"SSL"`, where it has two fields, one called "Cert" and the other `Key`. "which you must complete so that the SSL of the backend server can be done, for example:

```bash
"SSL": {
    "Cert": "./MyCertFile.crt",
    "Key": "./MyKeyFile.key"
}
```
